Assignment 1 is based on transforming a large dataset in text format - over 5000 lines of text.

You will need to read in a file, scrub (clean) the data, place it into the relevant holder/container objects and save the output in a csv format.

Once in these objects you will see that there are 422 different sets of commit objects.

The deadline is the 10th December 2017 on moodle @ 23:55.



seperated commit messages by 72 hypens

seek, see for next lines , read into array, indexOf

for line in x, member variables. commit objects, changed path could be a single cell.

look out for commas!

while !eof search for 72 hyphens
then split next line into
revision numbers/author, datetime, #of comments, 
search for empty lines
comment = index + 1:
changes paths = lines between changed paths and blank line

repeat ^
